# UML Class Diagram
Consider a basketball conference. Each conference has 10 teams. Each team has 12 players. Each player has a specific height, speed, and accuracy. Players know which team they belong to. Some players are scholarship players. Scholarship players need to record their current grade-point average. Players may be transferred between teams. Teams play basketball games against other teams in the conference. The result of each game is determined using a function based on the height, strength, speed, and accuracy of the players on each team. Design a system for simulating this basketball conference.
